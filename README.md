## Introduction

The consumption of oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide are essential for generating the necessary amount of energy for each individual. Therefore, the human body requires a system that ensures this process. We are talking about the respiratory system.
The respiratory system consists of respiratory pathways that facilitate the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere (nasal cavity, trachea, etc.) and intrapulmonary pathways that carry air from the respiratory pathways to the pulmonary alveoli; these are referred to as bronchi and bronchioles. These can be affected by several diseases, including bronchitis, asthma, and bronchiectasis.

Asthma, derived from the Greek word "Azein" meaning to breathe with difficulty, is an allergic respiratory issue that causes chronic inflammation of the airways. It's marked by recurring episodes of wheezing and breathing difficulty. Asthma symptoms involve three pathological processes:

Chronic Airway Inflammation:
Asthma primarily develops due to an inflammatory reaction of the bronchial lining. Various inflammatory cells and mediators contribute to the distinctive pathological changes. This airway inflammation is closely tied to early-life exposures, hyperreactivity, and asthmatic symptoms. In cases of asthma, inflammation persists even during episodic symptoms. Notably, bronchial mast cells, eosinophils, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils play significant roles in this inflammatory response.

Bronchial Hyperreactivity:
Asthmatic individuals exhibit bronchial hyperreactivity as their disease progresses, rendering the bronchial system overly sensitive and prone to contraction upon exposure to specific triggers such as allergens, viruses, and cold air. This hyperreactivity is associated with airway inflammation and can be partially reversible through medical treatment.

Bronchial Obstruction:
Airflow restriction in asthma primarily results from the abrupt narrowing of bronchial passages. This obstruction is mainly due to spasms in the smooth bronchial muscles. Additionally, edema, thickening of bronchial walls, and excessive mucus production contribute to airway constriction.
